# income-analysis-USA-Clustering


<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the project

A complete data analysis of census income in the US using Python and several clustering algorithms (kMeans, kMediods) to find a model which clusters the samples right in people that earn more or less than $50000 per year. 

We look at several metrics of each clustering algo (purity, entropy, decision boundary etc.) on our specific dataset to determine the quality of a model and compare them against other models/clustering algo. 

The analyzed dataset can be found here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult
